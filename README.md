# Configuration

This repository contains some configuration useful for both my mac and linux machines. The most important 
is my vim setup - which I never could get consistent between machines before making this repo.

To setup a new machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathanhood/config.git
cd config
./pull_submodules.sh
./setup_system.sh
./install_software.sh
```
