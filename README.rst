Configuration
=============

This repository contains some configuration useful for both my mac and linux machines. The most important 
is my vim setup - which I never could get consistent between machines before making this repo.

To setup a new machine::

  > git clone https://github.com/jonathanhood/config.git
  > cd config
  > sh pull_submodules.sh
  > sh setup_system.sh
